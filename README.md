# Abstract

Image fusion plays a significant role for proper diagnosis of diseases in the field of medical sciences. This work proposes a robust fusion technique which effectively integratesthe useful but complimentary information from the source images of different modalities into a signal image frame. Non-subsampled contourlet transformation (NSCT) is applied to decompose the images into low-frequency and highfrequency sub-bands in order to capture the salient features from all directions. The low-frequency sub-band is further decomposed into phase and amplitude spectrum using Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) followed by Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). For integration of phase spectrum, parametrically optimized Pulsed Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) based fusion rule is used and for the amplitude spectrum, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based fusion rule has been deployed. To combine the high-frequency subband coefficients, an edge based novel fusion rule has been implemented. From the subjective and objective analysis of the fused images, it can be seen that the proposed fusion scheme is able to highlight all kind of minute information in a less computationally complex way than other existing methods.
